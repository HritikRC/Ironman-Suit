# Ironman-Suit
In this repository, you can find all the necessary code for my ironman suit project!

My project for the summer of 2021 was to build a wearable Ironman Helmet and Arm using the raspberry pi microprocessor! This would combine all my knowledge of raspberry pi robotics and web server coding! 
- HUD: AR & VR and Sensor Data GUIs, Object Detection and Recognition
- JARVIS AI: Voice Detection, Voice Commands, Text to Speech
- Components: Ultrasonic, Accelerometer, Temperature Sensors + Servo Motors
- Missile Launcher: Powered by flicking fingers or JARVIS
- LED Eyes: Turned on or off using JARVIS
Very successful project. A few improvements include, better AR/VR option as it takes a lot of space in the helmet, making the build stronger - perhaps 3D printing some parts.
